        <h2>An Overview</h2>
            <p class="overview">
                My name is Ian, I am 29 years old, and I'm super stoked to get my butt kicked by this program! I grew up in California, but before moving to Portland in 2017, I spent 5 years living in Aarhus, Denmark. Music has been the focus of my life up until very, very recently. I have a part time job doing quality control for a company that manufacturers aerospace parts which really enjoy...I get to spend lots of time staring at schematics for plane and sattelite parts.

            <p class="overview">
                If I'm not working or making music, chances are you can find me rock climbing and bouldering or out at the beach surfing. The surf is surprisingly good here in Oregon. Few things in life feel as good as getting your butt kicked by nature only to finaly conquer it. Although...there was this one time surfing where nature definitely won. The scars I have on my face are from going face first into an underwater rock while surfing. I broke my nose in two places, but somehow didn't lose teeth, and didn't lose consciousness. I still love surfing, albeit a little more carefully! If anyone else surfs or climbs, we should totally go out some time! During the off season for both of these sports, I spend a decent amount of time at the indoor bouldering gym Circuit. I have yet to discover how much free time I'll have for climbing and making music while in the throes of of this coding bootcamp.

                Although I grew up in California, my entire immediate family has immmigrated up to the PNW over the last decade! I have a younger brother and sister who are twins. My sister is an emergency room nurse in Beaverton, and my brother is actually at this same bootcamp in the cohort ahead of me! My parents moved to Woodland, Washington about a year ago, so all of us are up here now. I have an older half sister who lives in Fresno, California. She has two kids, with a third due in December! Uncle Ian is pretty stoked to have a new family member!

        <h2>Life in Denmark</h2>
            <p class="denmark">
                I moved to Denmark about two weeks after I turned 21 in 2011. Strange timing considering Americans wait their whole life to turn 21 to start drinking, only to move to a country with no drinking age. I moved there to continue my musical education, and to retain my Danish citizenship. Denmark has laws regarding dual citizenshup that require a foreign national to have established ties to the country by the time they turn 22, so I moved there to establish those ties and retain my citizenship in perpituity. The initial plan was to live there for one year, but things snowballed quite beautifully and I ended up staying for a full five years, almost to the day.
            </p>
            <p class="denmark">
                Upon arriving in Denmark, I went to a performing arts school aptly named Performer's House in a city named Silkeborg. To put it simply, this was a magic place. Denmark has a form of schools called højskole, which is basically a school you would go to in between high school and university. It is common in Denmark to take a few gap years before going to University, and one of the things lots of people do is attend højskole. There are a wide range of these types of schools where people can focus on different subjects; different types of art like photography or glass blowing, physical subjects like sports and health, sciences like biology and physics, or in my case, performing arts! These schools are relatively small, typically with attendance between 50-200 students at a time. Students live at the school in dorm rooms and share meals together, and spend the rest of their times in class for their individual lines. Performer's House had a line for electronic music which is what I was taking, theater, dance, nu-circus (think Cirque de Solei style circus), and a more traditional band oriented music line. Let me tell you, it was WILD living with 60 other performing artists for a year. The school put together weekly "cafes" to demonstrate what everyone was working on and get practice performing in front of an audience, and they always turned in to wild parties. There are virtually no laws about alcohol in Denmark so the school basically sponsered these parties and we got to drink with teachers and let completely loose. The cafes usually had themes as well like gender bender and under the sea, so we would decorate our huge performance space and stage and perform perform perform. It was undoubtedly one of the best times of my life. The school was an international school, and I have friends for life from over 15 different countries around the world, people I will love dearly forever.
            </p>
            <p class="denmark">
                After leaving performers, I moved to Denmark's second biggest city called Aarhus. Aarhus is an amazing city, and feels much larger than its population of 300,000 would suggest. It's amazing how much life a city can have when a government spends money on culture. Venues get state support so local bands can play on the same stages as huge international headliners. The city commonly throws large outdoor parties and festivals, bolstered by the fact that you can publically drink in Denmark. It turns out people spend lots of money all over a city when you can drink in public, and it significantly contributes to the art scene's economic viability.
                <br>
                Anyway, I lived in Aarhus for the remaining four years I lived in Denmark. I made a living running a music collective and DJing lots of art gallery openings. In the last year living there, I was also working as a live sound technician at a venue called "HeadQuarters". Life in Denmark was truly the best experience of my life so far, og jeg drommer hverdage om at flytte tilbage til Danmark. Måske jeg kan få et job som et programmør i København.

        <h2>Musical Background</h2>
            <p class="music">
                Music has always been a significant part of my life. I started my musical journey as a drummer and percussionist at the age of 12. I started playing in my middle school's orchestra and jazz band. In high school, I atteneded a magnet school for music called Marin School of the Arts. I played timpanis in their symphonic band for three years, helped found their rock and blues program, and played in their jazz band for two years. The school regularly competed at music festivals all over the state and a few interstate competitions and we always destroyed everyone; no contest always came in first for all three years I was in the program type of destroyed. The bands had some of the best musicians in the state so we would play outlandishly advanced pieces and could even compete against colleges. It was amazing.

            <p class="music">
                After a brief two year stint at the University of Santa Cruz in California studying bioengineering, I decided to swtich back to a profession in music. In 2010 I attended a year and a half long vocational program for recording engineering and music production in San Francisco. It gave me a massively wide skill set for working in the music industry and helped me start my business in Denmark, as well as continue to work with music here in Portland.
            </p>
            <p class="music">
                Over the last few years I've acquired a pretty impressive list of gear for making music and recording, which has nicely lent itself to working with a lot of different musicians here in Portland. Up until I started this coding program, I was part of a duo in which we live performed techno with hardware, no DJing! I was on my drum machine, an Elektron Analog Rytm MKII, and my partner was on a sampler. We would do 2 hour long shows of 100% improvised techno, and we slayed. It was rad. I have a lot of other collaborators that come over to utilize some of the other super rad gear I have. I did some work for a grammy-winning blues producer from the 60s and 70s for a while who was looking to sell a lot of amazing vintage gear, soooo I ended up spending way more money than I made working for him buying his gear. I have a pretty sweet studio now because of it, and plan on working with music forever recording various personal projects and the occasional commisioned job. Some of my gear includes:
